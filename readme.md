# Surdeigsbrød

Welcome to the Surdeigsbrød project! This is a simple tool to help you calculate the amount of water and flour needed based on the amount of sourdough starter you have. This project is a practice exercise to help me learn to code.

## Features

- Calculate the amount of water needed
- Calculate the amount of flour needed

## Usage

1. Input the amount of sourdough starter you have.
2. The tool will calculate and display the required amounts of water and flour.

## Example

If you have 100 grams of sourdough starter, the tool might suggest:
- 144 grams of water
- 250 grams of flour
